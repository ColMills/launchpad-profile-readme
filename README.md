<summary><h2>Hello There!</h2></summary>

Hello there! my name is Chris, and im a student in Riverside, CA. I am attending school for Theater and Music Technology, but i am greatly interested in a variety of hobby uses. One of my recent and most advanced projects is a Minecraft server running on a raspberry pi 4 where i have learned a bit of linux and hope to progress to beyond a begginer skill level one day.
